# RFC-001: Integration Framework - Plugin Connectors

## Summary
This RFC proposes a flexible plugin architecture to enable third-party integrations with the Perplexity Library Power Overlay.

## Motivation
Users need seamless integration with tools like Obsidian, Notion, and the Perplexity API to enhance their research workflows.

## Proposed Solution

### Plugin Interface
- Define a standard `PluginConnector` interface
- Implement a centralized `PluginRegistry`
- Support dynamic plugin loading and lifecycle management

### Initial Connectors
1. **Obsidian Connector**: Export saved items to Obsidian vault
2. **Perplexity API Connector**: Programmatic access to Perplexity features

## Implementation Plan
1. Create `PluginConnector.interface.ts` with standard plugin interface
2. Implement `PluginRegistry.ts` for plugin management
3. Build initial connectors (Obsidian, Perplexity)
4. Add plugin configuration UI
5. Document plugin development guide

## Open Questions
- Authentication flow for third-party services?
- Rate limiting and quota management?
- Versioning strategy for plugin API?

## Status
**DRAFT** - Awaiting team review and feedback
